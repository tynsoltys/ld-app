# ld-app

👋 Hello and welcome to Tyn's Take Home Test for logDNA!

🚂 visit the app here.

### 🏃‍♀️ How to run the app:

1. Download or clone the ld-app to your local environment.
2. Open 2 terminals: one in the `/api` directory and one in the `/client` directory.
3. Run `npm start` in each of those.
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 🎉 Highlights to check out:

1. 💌 First, send me a message.. the expected behaviour is to receive a pop-up note with your message. Errors will just be in a boring alert, but could refactor this later to be more consistent. _👉 Note that these are going to a DB and I am going to read them so be nice ❤️_
2. 🖱 Hover over the logo, the sidenav, and the articles list for some cool css fun (I know I wasn't supposed to do this but this girl's gotta have fun 🎉).
3. 🎨 Check out the CSS used to recolour the logdna logo to match the mockup (now I'm just flexing 💪).
4. //TODO react and other highlights
